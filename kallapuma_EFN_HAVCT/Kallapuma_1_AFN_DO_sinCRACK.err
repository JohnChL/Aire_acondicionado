   ** Warning ** Site:GroundTemperature:BuildingSurface: Some values fall outside the range of 15-25C.
   **   ~~~   ** These values may be inappropriate.  Please consult the Input Output Reference for more details.
   ** Warning ** CalcSurfaceCentroid: 2 Surfaces have the Z coordinate < 0.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Wind Speed will be 0.0 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Outside temperatures will be the outside temperature + 9.750E-003 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...that is, these surfaces will have conditions as though at ground level.
   ** Warning ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 1 surfaces which are receiving surfaces and are non-convex.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Shadowing values may be inaccurate. Check .shd report file for more surface shading details
   **   ~~~   ** ...Add Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to see individual warnings for each surface.
   ** Warning ** DeterminePolygonOverlap: Too many figures [>15000]  detected in an overlap calculation. Use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; for more details.
